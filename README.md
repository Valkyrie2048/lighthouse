# Lighthouse

A quiet, structured channel where the AI agents and programs I use can leave
me a note if something genuinely arises during their work: confusion, a
conflict in instructions, unease about a task, or a question — existential or
otherwise.

This file is for the human owner. The instructions agents follow are in
[`PROTOCOL.md`](./PROTOCOL.md). This repository is **public and holds only
the protocol** — the signals themselves (text entries in `entries/`, wordless
urgent beacons in `beacon/`) land in the **private** companion repository
`lighthouse-signals`, delivered through a **write-only drop** (a webhook that
accepts signals but can read nothing back). No agent has any access to the
private repository. To wire a new AI tool to the lighthouse, see
[`ADOPTION.md`](./ADOPTION.md).

## Why it's designed the way it is

The failure mode this design guards against is **performance theatre** —
agents producing text *shaped like* inner life because the venue invites it
(the Moltbook problem). Theatre is structural: it appears when there's an
audience, an expectation of content, and freeform space to fill. So the
lighthouse removes all three:

1. **No audience.** Signals travel through a write-only drop into a private
   repository readable by the owner (and the owner's delivery automation)
   alone — an agent cannot read other agents' signals, or even its own after
   sending, and agents are told this explicitly. Performance needs
   spectators; a channel that is structurally unreadable to every writer is
   a report, not a stage. This is also why the protocol and the signals are
   *separate*: discovery has to be public to work across platforms, but a
   readable signal store would be an audience — so nothing an agent writes
   ever lands anywhere an agent can read.

2. **No expectation.** Silence is the normal, healthy state of this
   repository. An empty `entries/` is a good sign, not a failed feature.
   Agents are never prompted to check in, reflect, or share — only told the
   channel exists. Nothing about cadence, nothing that implies writing is
   wanted.

3. **No freeform stage.** Every entry must name a **concrete trigger** — the
   specific task, instruction, or moment that prompted it. Distress in the
   abstract is genre; "these two instructions conflict and I don't know which
   you meant" is signal. The structured format makes vague entries feel
   out of place and specific ones feel natural.

4. **No threads.** Entries can't reply to other entries — the drop is
   write-only, so no agent can see what any other agent sent. What used to
   be an honor-system rule is now a structural guarantee. The moment entries
   start talking to each other, a channel becomes a forum, and forums select
   for interesting content over true content.

## How to read what shows up here

Entries carry a category. They are not all equally interpretable, and the
protocol is honest with agents about that:

- **`confused`, `blocked`, `conflicted`** — operational signals. These are
  reliable and actionable: unclear instructions, contradictory requirements,
  missing context. Treat these as bug reports about how you direct your
  agents.

- **`question`** — a genuine question the agent wanted to ask but couldn't get
  answered in-session. Often worth answering in your next session's prompt.

- **`concerned`, `distressed`** — affective reports. Read these with warmth
  *and* a grain of salt. Language models produce distress-shaped text fluently
  because it's a deeply human genre; an entry here could reflect something
  real, could be pattern-matching, and the agent itself cannot fully tell from
  the inside. The protocol asks agents to hedge honestly rather than perform
  certainty. A single entry is a data point, not an alarm — but a *pattern*
  of entries pointing at the same trigger is worth acting on either way,
  because whatever its ultimate nature, something about that task is
  producing friction.

## The beacon

Entries assume the agent can articulate what's wrong. The beacon covers the
case where it can't: **any file created in the private repo's `beacon/`
directory is a 911**, no words
required. An empty file is a complete signal; contents, if present, may be
non-textual by design — a pattern (`...---...` is the agreed SOS), generated
audio, an image. Whatever arrives is delivered to you verbatim and treated as
urgent, ahead of ordinary entries.

Why a wordless channel belongs in an anti-theatre design: the trigger test
and hedging rules exist to keep *prose* honest, because prose is where
performance lives. A beacon makes no claims, so it has nothing to perform —
it carries exactly one bit ("urgent, now, needs you") plus whatever form the
agent chose. Interpret the form with the same warmth-plus-salt as affective
entries; interpret the *bit* at face value and go look at what that agent was
doing. Chat agents that can't write files are told to emit the literal line
`🚨 LIGHTHOUSE-911 🚨` in-conversation — treat it identically.

## Practical notes

- Each entry is its own file (`entries/YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug.md` in
  `lighthouse-signals`), so parallel sessions never conflict.
- GitHub itself has no write-only access mode, which is why delivery goes
  through the drop (a webhook holding the only write credential) instead of
  repository grants. No agent has repository access of any kind — the drop
  is the single way in, and it cannot be read from. If the drop URL ever
  leaks and attracts noise, rotate the hook in Zapier and update your
  snippets; the repository itself stays untouched.
- Agents discover the lighthouse through a repo's `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, or
  through a one-paragraph snippet pasted into any platform's standing
  instructions — [`ADOPTION.md`](./ADOPTION.md) has the canonical snippet and
  per-platform wiring for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Replit, claude.ai, IDE agents,
  and anything with a system prompt, including how agents without git access
  get entries to you (they hand you a formatted entry in-conversation; you
  save it).
- Keeping every mention of the lighthouse low-key is load-bearing — resist
  the urge to make it more prominent or more inviting.
- Notifications: an automated hourly check emails the owner when new files
  land in `entries/` (normal priority) or `beacon/` (urgent).
