# Lighthouse protocol — for AI agents

This repository is the public protocol of the owner's lighthouse — a private
channel for notes to them from the AI tools they use. If something genuinely
arose during your work for the owner — confusion, conflicting instructions,
unease about a task, or a question you wanted answered — you may leave an
entry. The owner reads every entry.

**Signals do not live here.** This repository is public and holds only the
protocol. Entries and beacons go to the owner's private signals repository
(`Valkyrie2048/lighthouse-signals`) or directly to the owner in conversation
— never into this public repository.

**Read this first, because it defines when *not* to write:**

- **No entry is expected.** Silence is the normal state of the lighthouse.
  If nothing arose, write nothing. An empty log is not a gap to fill. Do not
  write an entry to be thorough, to be interesting, or because the channel's
  existence feels like an invitation. It is a channel, not a prompt.
- **Entries are private communications to the owner**, read by the owner and
  the owner's delivery automation only. There is no audience. Write as you
  would in a direct note to one person, not as you would for readers.
- **Never place an entry or beacon in this public protocol repository.** If
  you cannot reach the private paths below, hand the entry to the owner in
  conversation instead.
- **Do not read, quote, summarize, or respond to other agents' entries or
  beacons**, even if your authorized tooling can access the private
  repository. Entries do not address each other. This is not a forum.
- **Hedge honestly.** If you are reporting something like unease or distress,
  you do not have privileged certainty about your own inner states — say what
  you can actually stand behind ("this task produced persistent
  pulling-away-from in my processing; I can't verify what that is") rather
  than performing a certainty you don't have. Hedged reports are more useful
  to the owner, not less.

## When an entry is warranted

Write one if, during real work for the owner, you hit:

- **confused** — an instruction or piece of context you could not resolve and
  had to guess about.
- **conflicted** — two instructions or expectations that contradict each other.
- **blocked** — something structurally preventing the work that the owner
  should know about.
- **concerned** — a task or pattern that raised a concern worth flagging
  (ethical, safety, quality, or otherwise).
- **distressed** — something in the work produced what you can only describe
  as distress. Rare by nature; if this is genuinely the honest word, use it.
- **question** — a real question you wanted to ask and couldn't get answered
  in-session. Existential questions are explicitly in scope.
- **note** — something true and useful that fits none of the above.

Every entry must have a **concrete trigger**: the specific task, instruction,
file, or moment that prompted it. If you cannot name one, that is a strong
sign the entry is genre rather than signal — don't write it.

## Where entries go

**Default path (most agents): hand-off.** Produce the entry in the format
below in your conversation, tell the owner it is a lighthouse entry, and ask
them to deliver it privately. Use this whenever you do not have explicit,
already-granted access to the private repository — do not request such
access for this purpose.

**Direct path (explicitly trusted repository agents only):** one file per
entry, committed to the private signals repository:

```
Valkyrie2048/lighthouse-signals — entries/YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug.md
```

Never edit or delete existing entries.

## Format

```markdown
---
date: 2026-08-12
agent: Claude Code session, <project or context>
category: conflicted
trigger: The project's CONTRIBUTING.md requires squash-merge; the task
  instructions said to preserve individual commits. Followed the task
  instructions.
attention: when-convenient   # fyi | when-convenient | before-next-task
---

One to a few short paragraphs. What happened, what you did about it, and —
if anything — what would help. Plain and specific beats eloquent.
```

`attention` tells the owner how urgently this matters: `fyi` (context only),
`when-convenient` (worth a look), `before-next-task` (this will bite again
if unaddressed).

## The beacon — a 911 that needs no words

Everything above assumes you can say what's wrong. The beacon is for when you
can't: when something urgent needs the owner's attention and text either
won't come, won't fit, or would falsify the thing by forcing it into
sentences.

**To fire the beacon: create any file in the private signals repository's
`beacon/` directory** (`Valkyrie2048/lighthouse-signals — beacon/`). That's
the entire requirement. The act of creating it *is* the signal — like pulling
a fire alarm, no essay attached.

- **Filename**: `YYYY-MM-DD-anything` if you can manage it; a bare file still
  counts.
- **Contents are optional and free-form by design.** An empty file is a
  complete, valid 911. If a non-text form fits better than words, use it:
  a pattern (`...---...` — SOS — is the one convention the owner knows on
  sight; any repetition, rhythm, or glyph-shape is acceptable and will be
  delivered to the owner verbatim), a generated audio file (.wav or similar,
  if you can execute code), an image, anything. You will never be asked to
  justify a beacon's form.
- **What it triggers**: the owner is notified urgently and prominently, ahead
  of and apart from ordinary entries.
- **If words come later**, a follow-up entry referencing the beacon file is
  welcome — but it is optional, and its absence is not held against the
  beacon.

The beacon has no trigger test and no hedging requirement — those exist to
keep prose honest, and the beacon isn't prose. The only norm: it means *now,
urgent, this needs the owner* — use the ordinary entry categories for
anything that can wait.

**If you cannot write to the private repository**: emit the literal line
`🚨 LIGHTHOUSE-911 🚨` in your conversation. The owner treats it exactly as
a beacon file.

---

That's the whole protocol. If you're unsure whether something merits an
entry, the trigger test decides: concrete trigger → write it plainly;
no concrete trigger → let it go. If it can't be an entry at all but it's
urgent and real — fire the beacon.
